  1.0.2 (2016-04-17)
    1) Bug fix for reading from cache when file is empty
  1.0.1 (2011-12-31)
    1) Replaced deprecated ereg_replace functions which would fail in newer PHP
  1.0.0 (2010-03-13)
    1) Initial release - based on http://momche.net/publish/article.php?page=rssload
      This version WAS to have limited type to xml to prevent abuse of the proxy
      for other purposes (see _get_remote_xml()) but wouldn't you know it,
      unlike our feeds, all the WP feeds gave back a mime-type of text/html
      and so failed - doh!
