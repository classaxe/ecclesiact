  1.0.4 (2012-11-21)
    1) Now Posting_Container::set_default_enclosure_folder() checks the parent
       folder if there is one, and then builds default folder based on parent
       path combined with the name of the object represented.
       Also checks that the path is properly prefixed ad suffixed with a slash
