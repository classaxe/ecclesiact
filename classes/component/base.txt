  1.0.3 (2015-03-17)
    1) \Component\Base::drawStatus() now uses new HTML::drawStatus() in place of old snake-case named method
  1.0.2 (2015-03-07)
    1) Moved backward deprecated non-camel-cased backward compatability methods out into old component_base class
       This class is now FULLY PSR-2 compliant - erm, except for property naming of course.
  1.0.1 (2015-03-04)
    1) Changes to static method calls from self:: to static:: to support overriding
    2) Bug fix - deprecated get_help() method wasn't returning content
    3) Added Base::getJSSafeID() method
  1.0.0 (2015-03-01)
    1) Moved from Component_Base and reworked to use namespaces
    2) Aliases for PSR-2 and backward-compliant function calls:
         base::_draw_control_panel()    ->      Base::drawControlPanel()
         base::_draw_status()           ->      Base::drawStatus()
         base::_get_safe_ID()           ->      base::getSafeID()
    3) Fully PSR-2 Compliant EXCEPT for backward-compatable stubbed method names
